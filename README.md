##  Instructions

Did you know you can do a lot of awesome stuff with the terminal ? For example, all Ubuntu users, type:
`telnet towel. blinkenlights. nl`

Press enter, sit back and enjoy the show!
Let's look at some of the things we can use the terminal for  _**(in Ubuntu or any other Ubuntu based OS'es)**_

## Exercises

These exercises are meant to be done alone, think about what you do, how you do it and what you can learn from completing the individual challenges.

##  Exercise 1:

1.  Find out how to update your PC
2.  Find out how to  **upgrade**  your PC
3.  **Wow, what?! What does upgrade mean??**  Look up the difference between the two...

### Exercise 2:
1.  Execute the following command  `sudo apt install cowsay`
2.  Run  `cowsay -l`  to see which animals you can select

2.  Move to your desktop with the terminal (use  `cd`)
3.  Use  `ls`  to see which files and folders are in your current location
